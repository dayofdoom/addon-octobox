Take back control of your GitHub notifications.

## About

If you manage more than one active project on GitHub, you probably find
GitHub notifications pretty lacking.

Notifications are marked as read and disappear from the list as soon as you load
the page or view the email of the notification. This makes it very hard to keep
on top of which notifications you still need to follow up on.

Most open source maintainers and GitHub staff end up using a complex combination
of filters and labels in Gmail to manage their notifications from their inbox.
If, like me, you try to avoid email, then you might want something else.

Octobox is an beautiful application that manages your GitHub notifications via
GitHub’s API, allowing you to filter down by organization, project,
notification type, or the reason why you are receiving the notification in the
first place.

It is easy to drill down in to the issues that matter to you in the current
moment while still allowing you to be subscribed to projects that you’d like
to keep an eye on. You can quickly address threads that you’ve authored yourself
or remember that you still need to submit your review that someone requested.
You can “star” long-running issues that you know might be important down the
road.

A true must-have for every GitHub opensource contributor.
